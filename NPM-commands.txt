Equal sign means you want the EJS template to print out a variable.

After loading data:
 - Pass through routes to templates
 - Or, attach it to app.locals


If loaded into app.locals, the objects in the data file will become global variables in app.locals 

Watch out for HTML in .json files!  Use "-" instead of "=" in EJS tags.
